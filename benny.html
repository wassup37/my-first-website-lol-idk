this is my 1st webpage!!1!!! <b> idk what 2 do with it yet considering its a local file. </b> im <b> ACTUALLY </b> going to publish this website to the internet using github. this is a coding basic, so dont congratulate me on this. its just random things that i learned to put here, such as using bold words. that really the only thing i learned :(
i dont know any other way to upload this <b> local file </b> to the internet, so im going to create a github repository.
